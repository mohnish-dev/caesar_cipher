# caesar_cipher
The Caesar Cipher Simulator is a C++ command-line application that allows users to encode and decode messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example: 
Suppose you want to encode the message "HELLO" with a shift value of 3.
Each letter is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet:

'H' becomes 'K' (shifted from position 7 to position 10)

'E' becomes 'H'

'L' becomes 'O'

'L' becomes 'O'

'O' becomes 'R'

The encoded message would be "KHOOR".

Decoding Example
To decode the message "KHOOR" with the same shift value of 3, each letter is shifted 3 positions backward in the alphabet:

'K' becomes 'H'

'H' becomes 'E'

'O' becomes 'L'

'O' becomes 'L'

'R' becomes 'O'

The decoded message would be "HELLO".
